      "3. How do plants detect the presence of light in the dark?\n",
      "\n",
      "Plants use a process called phototropism, where they move towards the light. The movement is due to the sensation of light on their leaves and stems.\n",

      "4. How are chloroplasts used in photosynthesis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Chloroplasts are organelles that contain the enzymes and machinery that catalyze the process of photosynthesis.\n",

      "5. How does the process of photosynthesis differ between plants and algae?\n",

      "7. What are the steps in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis?\n",
      "\n",
      "The light-dependent reactions involve the absorption of light energy by photosystem II, which is located in the thylakoid membrane. The electrons travel down the thylakoid membrane to the central complex, which generates ATP and NADPH.\n",

      "13. What is the difference between the light-dependent and light-independent reactions in photosynthesis?\n",
      "\n",
      "The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis contain several stages, including light-dependent electron transport, light-dependent reactions, and the chloroplast's thylakoid membrane. The light-independent reactions occur in the chloroplast's central structure.\n",

      "\n",
